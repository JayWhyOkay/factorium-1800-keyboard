# Factorium Keyboard

Factorium is a keyboard in CP layout inspired by CFTKB's Discipline and Mysterium Keyboard

**Project is in hiatus indefinitely until further notice **

## Differences between Mysterium and Factorium
- Added numpad 
- Move arrow keys down and right
- Addition of F13
- Removal of two navigation buttons 

## ToDo
- Standardize placement of arrows and num cluster to proper unit ratios (0.25 down and right for arrow keys, 1.25U for numpad)
- Adjust mounting points to be equidistant from the edges 
- Create smaller logo for silk screen printing 
- Design Acrylic feet 

## Images
coming once prototypes are ordered
